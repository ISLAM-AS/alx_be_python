#Python script that asks the user for their current age and then calculates how old they will be in a specific future year:

user_current_age = int(input("How old are you?")) #user must input their age

#perform the calculations
age = user_current_age + 27

#The script calculates and prints how old the user will be in 2050.
print("In 2050, you will be", age, "years old.")
