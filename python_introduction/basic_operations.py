#Assiging specific values for two variables, number1 and number2:
number1 = 10
number2 = 5

#Performing addition, subtraction, and multiplication on these numbers:
result = number1 + number2
difference = number1 - number2
product = number1 * number2

#Print the results of these operations in a human-readable format:
print("sum of", number1, "and", number2, "is", result)
print("difference of", number1, "and", number2, "is", difference)
print("product of", number1, "and", number2, "is", product)
