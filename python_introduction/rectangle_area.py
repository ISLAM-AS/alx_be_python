## Using basic Python operations to calculate the area of a rectangle using its length and width:

# Define the variables
length = 10  # The length of the rectangle
width = 5    # The width of the rectangle

# Calculate the area of the rectangle
area = length * width

# Print the result
print(f"The area of the rectangle is: {area}")
